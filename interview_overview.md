# Assessment Details:

**Objective**:

Create a dashboard report using any platform of your choice (Google Sheets, Slides, PowerBI, Tableau, etc.) that addresses the prompts in the attachment.

Be prepared to walk through the dashboard and explain the conclusions you derived from analyzing the prompts.

Detail the data cleaning steps you undertook.

Justify your choice of visualizations.

**Audience:**

The presentation will be for a non-technical academic board that oversees the departments annotated in the data.

**Presentation Time**:

You will have a cap of 25 minutes to present your findings and walk through your dashboard.

We believe this exercise will provide you an opportunity to showcase your analytical and presentation skills, and it will give us a glimpse into how you approach data-driven challenges.

**Please note** that the main goal of this assessment is to understand your thought process, analytical skills, and ability to communicate complex data to a non-technical audience. We're not just looking for the right answer but for a thoughtful approach and clear communication.

If you have any questions or require further clarification on any aspect of the assessment, please reach out to me as soon as possible to ensure you can adequately prepare for your presentation.

If you don't have a personal computer to bring with you for the presentation, please let us know in advance, and we will arrange one for you to use on-site. However, you would need to bring your presentation on a USB jump drive or ensure that it is accessible online so that you can access and present from our computer.

Guests can connect to our dedicated guest Wi-Fi network upon arrival for seamless internet access during their visit.

Looking forward to your presentation and discussion.
